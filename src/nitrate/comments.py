Code for dealing with Flickr comments.

In particular, some of Flickr's auto-link detection can be a bit wonky,
e.g. it detects Wikipedia URLs at the wrong point, so we have some code
that fixes it.  This module allows us to apply similar fixes across
all of our projects.

Callers only need one function from this file: ``fix_comment_text``.

    Fix Wikipedia links in Flickr comments.

    Flickr's comment parser will try to auto-detect links, and it assumes
    punctuation isn't part of links, but this breaks links to some
    Wikipedia pages, for example:

        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Barnes_Jr.

    It will omit the final period from the link, which means it goes to
    the wrong page.

    This is a particular issue for Flickr Commons, where people leave
    a lot of comments linking to Wikipedia pages.

    This function will fix the Wikipedia links auto-detected by Flickr.
    It moves any trailing punctuation that's part of the link inside
    the <a>.  We should never change the text of the comment, just move
    bits in/out of the <a>.
